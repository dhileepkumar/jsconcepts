Data Types 
    -> Primitive Data Types
        -> Number 
        -> Boolean
        -> String
        -> Symbol
        -> Null 
        -> Undefined 

    -> Non Primitives Data Types
        -> Array
        -> Object 

-> Primitive Data Types
    -> Number 
    -> String
    -> boolean
    -> Symbol
    -> Null and Undefined 

    -> Values dof primitive data type are immutable (cannot be changed)
    -> Primitive data types are compare by values
    -> js allow to access the property and methos of String, Number, Boolean and Symbol
        eg string.toLowerCase();
    -> while accessing the method and properties of the object special object will be created that know value and useful methods of the object that is beimg accessed 
        and its called "object wrappers"
    -> Once after accessing special objcet "Object Wrappers will be destroyed"

    -> Null and Undefined has no methods
        -> For this properties object wrappers will not be created whle accessing
    

-> Non Primitive data 
    -> Array
    -> Objects

  
    -> Non Primitive data type are Mutable and value can changed once after its created
    -> Objects are not compared by value
    -> Even if objecs and array have same value . it is not stictly equal
      -> This data Type is reffered to as reference types 
      -> Becouse Non Primitive data types are compared by referenc   

-> Number 
-> String 
-> Boolean
-> Null
-> Undefined
-> Array
-> Objects 

-> Number 
    -> number will be stored in 64 bit format ( IEEE-754, also known as “double precision”)
    -> JavaScripts use short format to store number of zeros 
        -> 10000000 = 1e7;
