Prototype 

    -> Prototype is hidden property
    -> Prototype is accessed using Object.getPrototypeOf() and Object.setProtoTypeOf()
    -> Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setProtoTypeOf() is quvalent to __prtoto__
    -> constructor function will be assigned to a variable
    -> All contructor function will have proptotype property by default
    -> each prototype created using new Objectname then the prototype wil be having the contructor fnction which to its own objwct 
    

    -> Object.prototype = this method is used to build prototype(__proto__) of the object when the object is created with new;
    -> Object.__proto__ is used to look up the prototype chain of the object
    -> array and Object both have prototype(__proto__) property it doest matters how the array/object is created.
    -> Every Object may have another object as its prototype. Former object inherits all of its prototype properties

    -> It may be null or reference to another object
    -> prototype is internal and hidden then are may ways to access it.

    ->__proto__ and prototype are different
    -> When we try to exccess the property of the object. which does not exists . then js search in prototype of the object 
    this is called prototypal inheritance
    -> Object will have default constructor in prototype even if have't assigned to It
    -> Constructor will point to its own function
    -> if we use this inside the prototype function . then - this points to the current object not to the function from which its inherited 
    -> if we assign or inherit any object to __proto__ then constructor function for the prototype will be destroyed
