Prototype 
    -> It may be null or reference to another object
    -> When we try to exccess the property of the object. which does not exists . then js search in prototype of the object 
    this is called prototypal inheritance
    -> Object will have default constructor in prototype even if have't assigned to It
    -> Constructor will point to its own function
    -> if we use this inside the prototype function . then - this points to the current object not to the function from which its inherited 
    -> if we assign or inherit any object to __proto__ then constructor function for the prototype will be destroyed
