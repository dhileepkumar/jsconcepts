Getters and Setters
-> Data Property 
-> Accessor Property 
    -> function that work on getting and setting vales . but it looks like regular properties to external code 

    let object = {
        get functionname(){

        }

        set functionname(parameter){

        }
    }

    getters 
        getter will not have any formal parameters. getters wil be invoked while reading the object 
    setters 
        setting will have only one formal parameter. setters will be invoked while writing to the object
        
    getter and setter will be visible while looping (using (for of) or (for in) )

    to access getters we have use var _variable_name = object.functionname
    to access setter we have to use object.functionname = _variable_name
