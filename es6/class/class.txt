Class : 
-------
    class is not a objects, ist like a blue print to generate the object and it classify the object based on its property
    Class always use strict
    Class cannot be called without new 
    Every class has constructor function that point to the same class.
    Even if haven't created contrucot for the class . There will be always a default constructor
    Method inside class will not have comma between them. (function inside the class is called methods except get,set and constructor)
    Constructor function name starts with capital letter

    Class has two components :
        -> class expression
        -> class Decleration

    Class Can be deleared in two methods :
        -> class Declerations 
            -> class UserDetails {
             }

             -> initiated by using new UserDetails();

        -> class expression 
            -> let Rectange  = class Rectange2 {

            }

            -> initiated  by using Rectange

        -> difference between class decleration and class expression is . in class decleration you can initiate class using class name like (new UserDetails()), 
           but with class expression you can only use variable name to the the function assgined to like new Rectange() you cannot use new Rectange2()

    constructor : 
        instance of the variable will be created and initiallised in contructor
    Hoisting :
        ->Difference between class decleation and function decleation is hoisting. function will be hoisted but class will not be hoisted like variables and function , Class Cannot be hoisted

    Static function : 
        static can be applied to function inside the class, 
        ststic method can be applied to the function not to the prototype
        Static function can be referenced by class name
        Static Method cannot be called by class Instance
